<p>From time to time, we may offer promotions or special opportunities (âPromotionsâ) on our Site. The Promotions may come in the form of incentives, such as, without limitation, credits or fee discounts. We may set or change the incentive types, amounts, terms, restrictions, and qualification requirements for any Promotion in our sole discretion and we reserve the right to cancel any active Promotion at any time. We also reserve the right to withhold or deduct credits or benefits obtained through a Promotion in the event that we determine or believe that the redemption of the promotion or receipt of the credit or benefit was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the applicable promotion terms or this Terms of Use.

As part of a Promotion, we may offer you incentives to refer third parties, including real estate agents, to the PrivateLoanWareHouse community (a âReferral Programâ). When you enter such a Referral Program or respond to such opportunity, we may require the submission of your name, e-mail address, postal address and other personally identifiable information. Any information collected by PrivateLoanWareHouse under a Referral Program shall be governed by PrivateLoanWareHouseâs Privacy Policy. We will use this personally identifiable information for purposes of managing the Promotion or opportunity, and may share this information with our affiliates and other service providers. Your participation in such a Referral Program is subject to these Terms of Use, including the Referral Program Rules, along with the terms and conditions specific to the Referral Program.</p>

You and the referred individual must satisfy these Terms of Use and the applicable terms and conditions for the Referral Program (âReward Criteriaâ) for you to qualify for the Referral Award. The Referral Rewards are set by PrivateLoanWareHouse in its sole discretion and are subject to change at any time. The Reward Criteria may vary by market or within a particular market. PrivateLoanWareHouse, at its sole discretion, may make available certain Promotions with different Reward Criteria or Referral Rewards to other Users or prospective Users. These promotions, unless offered to you, shall have no bearing whatsoever on your Agreement or relationship with PrivateLoanWareHouse.

Only one person can earn a Referral Reward for a single referral. In the event that multiple persons claim credit for a particular referral, PrivateLoanWareHouse has full discretion to determine which person earned such referral according to PrivateLoanWareHouseâs systems.</p>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">Reservation of rights</h6>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">Arbitration, Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Action Rights</h6>
<p>At our or your election, all disputes, claims, or controversies (âClaimsâ) arising out of or relating the following shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration to be conducted before the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ), or its successor: (a) Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, including but not limited to your use of the Site or the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; (b) Claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); (c) Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and (d) Claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms of Use.

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be held in Coeur D Alene, Idaho before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties cannot mutually agree, a single arbitrator appointed by AAA, and will be conducted in accordance with the current rules and regulations promulgated by AAA unless specifically modified in the Terms of Service. The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by either party. The arbitratorâs reasoned decision and award will be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the arbitration and within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation on actual compensatory, direct damages set forth in these Terms of Use and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under these Terms of Use, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. The arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing party) against any party to a proceeding. Any party refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, including attorneysâ fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm. The provisions of this arbitration section will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.

YOU AND PrivateLoanWareHouse AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and PrivateLoanWareHouse agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

In addition, you agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and PrivateLoanWareHouse are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Use.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the introductory section above, if we change this âArbitrationâ section after the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the âDate of Last Revisionâ date above or in the date of our email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and us in accordance with the provisions of this section as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).</p>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">Indemnity</h6>
<p>You agree to release, indemnify and hold PrivateLoanWareHouse, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, agents, contractors, partners and employees, harmless from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising out of or in connection with your User Content, any Third Party Services or related content you post or share on or through the Service, your use of the Service, your conduct in connection with the Service or with other Users of the Service, or any violation of these Terms of Use or of any law or the rights of any third party.</p>

You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software. The failure of PrivateLoanWareHouse to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision in that or any other instance. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held invalid, the remainder of these Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect. If any provision of these Terms of Use shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
